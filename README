The goal of this project is to create an app that users can use to help improve health and wellness. 
"Model Menu" is designed to track nutrition and hydration patterns over the course of a 365 day period 
to try and determine what food combinations lead to better energy levels, greater clarity, and could possibly 
be improving chronic illnesses or potentially making symptoms worse. The hope is not only to devise an 
optimal custom eating plan, but also to track down food combinations that are creating suboptimal wellness.

Let's do it.
